Only config files that end with .conf are consumed by rsyslog.  The other files
ending in .config are templates that WMT uses to enable/disable log forwarding.

DO NOT rename, edit, etc. any files in this directory unless you know what you
are doing.

Note:  Changes made on bluescape walls will be overwritten with future
updates of tsx_admin.
