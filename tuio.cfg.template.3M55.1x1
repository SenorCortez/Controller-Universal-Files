# For the purposes of this configuration file, a 'cell' is a display unit, such
# as a MultiTaction display, OR a regular monitor. Even if not all of your
# cells are touch-enabled, they must be accounted for in this configuration
# file. The reason for this is that Winmaster must know the entire width and
# height of the display array in order to generate a correct transformation
# matrix for each touch-enabled cell.
#
# For example, if you had an 8x3 display array, but only the upper left 2x2
# block were actually touch-enabled, you might be tempted to set width=2 and
# height=2 in this configuration file. This would have the effect that the
# upper left touch cell's input would be expanded relative to the display array
# dimensions, and appear across the entire first four columns and one and a
# half rows of the display array (and similar effects for the other touch
# cells).

# Width and height of the display cell array, in cells. The product of these
# two numbers is the number of cells total that Winmaster will listen for.
width = 1;
height = 1;

# If cells are pre-rotated in place, set their rotation angle here, in degrees
# counter-clockwise. For example, if the cells were rotated 90 degrees to the
# left, you would use 'rotate = 90;'. If the cells were rotated 90 degrees to
# the right, you would use 'rotate = 270;'.
rotate = 0;

# Winmaster will listen for TUIO frames on /n/ UDP ports,
# where /n/ = width * height. The 'startport' is the port that will be assigned
# to the upper left cell. Cell ports will be assigned in order by column,
# continuing on subsequent rows. For example, if you have a display cell
# array in a 3x2 configuration, and your startport were set to 40001, the cells
# would be numbered like so:
#
# +-------+-------+-------+
# | 40001 | 40002 | 40003 |
# +-------+-------+-------+
# | 40004 | 40005 | 40006 |
# +-------+-------+-------+
startport = 40001;
